# my portfolio page
i started with my decision about what tool to use for this project; i could've used regular javascript and or php, html css but to try something new i decided to go with angular. this is going to be my first attempt at using this tool so bear with me.

## step one
* getting it online

sinds i never really worked with angular, i gave myself the challenge to put it on github pages first. this proved to be harder to find than i thought. i had to change the "output-path" to "docs" and used the command: **ng buuild --output-path docs --base-href martekode.github.io**

this automatically deploys the page on github pages. BUT!! when i opened it it chowed the readme as the website. so i went into the settings on github of my repo and changed the /root to /docs and now it workes.

**now i can start working on the app...**
